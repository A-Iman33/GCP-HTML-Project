        <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
        <p>My passion for technology and problem-solving was inspired by my brother, who is a DevOps engineer. I've excelled in customer-focused roles, consistently receiving positive feedback from both customers and supervisors. The Generation programme further ignited my interest in merging technical expertise with exceptional customer service skills. Now, I'm determined to kickstart my career in the tech industry as a DevOps Engineer, where I can harness my exceptional combination of technical and interpersonal skills. <br></p>
        <p>Through the Generation Google Katalyst programme, I have gained a strong foundation in technical skills, including security, networking, Python programming, Google Cloud Digital Leader certification, and Associate Cloud Engineer. I have also developed strong command line interface skills through the intensive Linux labs. In addition, I have learned to work effectively with a team, brainstorm confidently, solve technical problems, and collaborate to complete projects on time. I have been able to acquire my Hashicorp Terraform certification as well as Professional Cloud Architect certification. I'm currently working towards gaining my Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) certification. <br></p>
        <p>As a tech enthusiast, I'm not only dedicated to my professional growth but also passionate about staying up to date with the latest industry trends. I engage in online communities to network with fellow tech enthusiasts and gain insights into emerging technologies. It's essential to me that I remain at the forefront of technological advancements to make a meaningful impact in the ever-evolving tech landscape. My future goal remains the same: to keep connecting the latest technology with practical solutions. I'm eager to start this journey, using my technical skills and commitment to delivering great service. As I keep learning and growing, I'm determined to have a lasting impact on the tech industry and the broader community. Thank you for getting to know me, and I'm excited to connect and work with people who share my love for innovation and making positive changes. <br></p>
